This project, presented at the Community Engagement Symposium 2025, uses Business Intelligence and data storytelling techniques to uncover patterns in health outcomes, housing access, and equity gaps among supportive housing residents in Los Angeles and Orange County.

**Key Objectives:**
- Analyze how living costs and food access impact resident health outcomes.
- Explore demographic disparities across supportive housing facilities.
- Use predictive analytics to identify residents at risk of crises.
- Provide actionable recommendations to enhance service delivery for housing organizations.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**

- Tableau – for building real-time, interactive dashboards.
- Excel/CSV Data Sources – housing surveys, cost of living datasets.
- Business Intelligence (BI) Methods – equity-centered analytics, gap analysis.
- Data Storytelling Techniques – to turn raw insights into meaningful narratives.

**Deliverables:**

- Visual dashboards highlighting demographic patterns, food access, satisfaction levels, and living cost comparisons.
- Data-driven recommendations for enhancing resident well-being and stability.
- Final presentation slides delivered at Cal State LA's Community Engagement Symposium 2025.

**✨Future Scope:**

- Expanding predictive analytics for early risk identification.
